# (WIP) O3DE 23.10.0 Feature List

**Status:** In Progress

**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** 23.10 release levels up the authoring experience for game creators and robotics simulation developers. In addition to improvements to the core engine, robotics users in O3DE now have the ROS2 Gem, a Gem that provides integration with the [Robot Operating System (ROS2)](https://www.ros.org/), which provides drivers, state-of-the-art algorithms, and developer tools for developing robotics simulations. Game developers in O3DE now have the [Multiplayer Sample game](https://github.com/o3de/o3de-multiplayersample) available to them - a ready-to-use game that's not only fun to play, but provides developers with example implementations of common game elements to help start their own projects.

## Highlights

Here are some highlights of O3DE 23.10.0, followed by a detailed list of features broken down by Special Interest Group (SIG).

1. New and Improved Authoring Experiences: Added compact nodes to Script Canvas. These are nodes that handle simple operations and are utilize less visual space, making for a more compact graph. 

2. New Document Property Editor: Need Description here

3. New Prefab Overrides: Need Description here

4. Installation and Gem Improvements: Automation to create remote object repos (gems, templates, and projects), Linux Snap packages for both Ubunti 20.04 and 22.04 support, many fixes to the installation and setup experience for Linux. 

5. Improved ability to export projects created with O3DE for Windows, Linux, Linux Server, and iOS. Android coming soon. 

6. Many visual and performance improvements to Atom (O3DE graphics and rendering system)

7. Robotics oriented features: Improvements to the robotics starter template
